Clock300 is a digital alarm clock/stopwatch, written in verilog, for the spartan3 educational boards, as a final project for the EC311 - Intro to Logic Design

Currently only the digital clock and stopwatch modes are implemented.  

The code would be easily portable to other FPGAs, but the clocks would be all off, for your reference, the Spartan3 used has a 50MHz clock.
